REPLIT BUILD PROMPT: MATCHLESS MARKETING WEBSITE
PROJECT OVERVIEW
Build a high-converting, mobile-first website for Matchless Marketing, an AI automation consulting service specifically for parent entrepreneurs. This is NOT a generic corporate consulting site. It needs to feel warm, relatable, and speak directly to overwhelmed parents running businesses from home.
Target Audience: Parent entrepreneurs doing $100k-900k revenue who are drowning in manual work (especially content creation), missing family time, and feeling left behind by competitors using AI.
Primary Goal: Convert visitors into $1,000-1,500 assessment bookings that lead to $500-1500/month retainer clients.
Brand Personality: Professional but approachable. Empathetic without being soft. Results-focused but acknowledges the chaos of parenting. Direct and clear, no corporate jargon.

CRITICAL: YOU HAVE TWO REFERENCE DOCUMENTS
Document 1: Relume Sitemap Structure
This defines the page structure, sections, and layout. Use this as your architectural blueprint.
Document 2: Complete Website Copy (matchless-marketing-complete-copy.md)
This contains ALL the actual copy for every section. DO NOT write your own headlines or body copy. Use the copy from this document EXACTLY as written. It's been professionally written for conversion.
Your job: Combine the sitemap structure with the provided copy to build a cohesive, high-converting website.

DESIGN DIRECTION
What This Site IS:

Warm and Relatable: Feels like talking to a friend who genuinely understands your struggle
Modern but Not Cold: Clean design with personality, not sterile tech-bro aesthetic

Visual References:

Look at: https://r3dpill.vercel.app/ (demo site from friend - note the clean, modern feel)

Critical Rule: USE THE PROVIDED COPY
The file matchless-marketing-complete-copy.md contains professionally written, conversion-optimized copy for every section.
DO NOT:

Write your own headlines
Paraphrase the copy
Use generic placeholder text
Skip sections

DO:

Copy the exact headlines, subheadlines, and body text from the document
Match the copy to the correct section from the Relume sitemap
Preserve formatting (bold, lists, callout boxes)
Use the provided CTAs word-for-word

Mapping Copy to Sections:
The copy document is organized by:

Page name (e.g., "PAGE 1: HOMEPAGE")
Section name (e.g., "SECTION 1: HERO HEADER")
Elements (Headline, Subheadline, Body, CTA)

Example:
Relume Sitemap says: "Hero Header Section"
Copy Document says: "SECTION 1: HERO HEADER"
Implementation: Use the headline "Stop Drowning in Business Tasks..." exactly as written
Special Copy Elements:
Callout Boxes:

Visually distinct (border, background color, or shadow)
Used for key quotes or important points
Example: "I was spending 15 hours a week on content..."

Bullet Points:

Use checkmarks (✓) for included features
Use standard bullets (•) for lists
Maintain hierarchy and indentation

Testimonials:

Name, business type, quote, photo placeholder
All provided in the copy document
Use as written (these are real clients)
